### Hi there, Welcome to my GitHub profile ðŸ‘‹
#### I'm Sirio and I'm currently graduating in Digital Humanities at the University of Pisa :it:
#### I am an intern at Intarget, a Digital Marketing company located not far from Pisa, with five offices around the world! They are helping me to develop my thesis: a *fully probabilistic framework* useful for positioning budget in advertising campaigns developed using **Bayesian Inference** (thanks to *PyMC3 library*). I'd be glad to share the code when it will be finished.
##### In this profile you can find some notebooks mainly focused on *data analysis*, *machine learning* and *data science*. These topics are my main fields of study, study and work.
##### As you may have already been clear, my favorite language is Python, although I also have a background in Java and R. Also, I like to use the BigQueary platform to run my quearies on large databases.
##### For me it is always a pleasure to come across a challenge that allows me to put my skills and creativity into play so feel free to contact me and even though I am still a beginner, I am always very curious about new fresh perspectives.
