### Hi there, Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋
#### I'm Sirio and I'm currently graduating in Digital Humanities at the University of Pisa 🗼
#### In this profile you can find some notebooks mainly focused on *data analysis*, *machine learning* and *data science*. These topics are my main fields of study, study and work 👨‍🔬
#### As you may have already been clear, my favorite language is Python, although I also have a background in Java and R. Also, I like to use the BigQueary platform to run my quearies on large databases 🐍
#### For me it is always a pleasure to come across a challenge that allows me to put my skills and creativity into play so feel free to contact me and even though I am still a beginner, I am always very curious about new fresh perspectives 🔰
