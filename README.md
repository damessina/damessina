### Hi there, Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋
#### This is my [resume](https://github.com/damessina/damessina/blob/main/CV_Sirio_Papa.pdf)! 
#### I'm Sirio and I'm currently graduating in Digital Humanities at the University of Pisa 🗼
#### In this profile you can find some code especially focused on *data science* and *machine learning*. These topics are my main fields of study and work 👨‍🔬
#### My favorite programming language is Python due to its flexibility, but I also have a background in Java and lately I have approached R 🐍
#### It is always a pleasure to come across a challenge that allows me to put my skills and creativity into play, so feel free to contact me and, even though I am still a beginner, I am very curious about new perspectives 🔰
